## Engine oil and filter replacement
The Engine should not be cold when performing this step, but it should not be to hot either, then you might get burnt when draining the oil. If the engine is cold, run the car for 3-6 min, this is enough. This will make the oil less viscous, and it will be easier to drain it.

This part is good to do after removing the air filter and before installing the new one, since we need to remove part of the air box to access the engine oil filter.

Remember to always use a new copper seal, when installing the oil plug. It is not necessary to use a new screw unless the old one is damaged. 

- Remove the engine cover (just pull, no screws)
- Remove the hose connecting the air box and the engine
- Add some paper under the oil filter cap (there will drop some oil)
- Unscrew the oil filter cap slightly 27mm socket (not all the way, just so that air can flow, when we remove the oil plug and drain the oil.
- Remove the fill cap (same reason as the step before)
- Lift car upp
- Remove cover by unscrewing all torx screws
- Remove oil plug and drain oil, The oil will flow directly once the oil plug is removed (tip use a magnetic stick and hold under the plug to catch it when it falls)
- Insert oil plug with new sealing, torque to 35 Nm
- Reinstall cover
- Lower the car down
- Fully remove the oil filter. be prepared with some paper, oil will drop from the filter.
- Remove the filter from the filter cap, this can require some force. The filter should just be pulled straight out of the cap.
- Remove the old sealing from the filter cap
- Apply some engine oil on the new sealing and put it on the filter cap
- install the new filter in the engine, and torque it to 25 Nm
- Add new oil. The engine holds 3.8l, but the filter also has some capacity. Therefore fill 3.9 to 4l of oil.
- Install the fill cap (important, don´t start the engine before this step)
- Start the engine and let it run for 1-2 min
- Check the oil level, and add more oil if needed

### Reset Oil service warning
You can reset the engine oil service warning without any tools, follow this procedure:
- Inset the key
- Turn the ignition on by pressing the start engine button on, without push on the brake or clutch (the engine should not start)
- Hold the t1/t2 trip button and the start engine button down at the same time until the "i" indication light on the dashboard starts to blink, at this point release both buttons
- At this point the service indication should be reset, verify by turning the ignition of, and then start the car as you normally do.

## Cabin Air filter replacement
This part is not hard, but it is quite annoying and time consuming. The filter is placed on the passenger side under/behind the glove compartment

- Remove the floor carpet 
- Remove 2 torx screws holding a plastic panel behind the glove compartment
- Remove the plastic panel and disconnect the power cable to the floor light
- Disconnect the power cable to the fuse box (blue clip) 
- Remove the fusebox by pushing a plastic clip on the top of the assembly, and pull straight out. You cant pull on the bottom, then you will break something.
- Remove the plastic cover leading to the compartment air filter, 3 clips
- Pull the old filter out
- Insert the new filter, try to not use to many swear words. Make sure to place the filter in the correct orientation, an arrow on the filter should indicate the airflow direction. The arrow should point in to the car.
- Close everything up

## Draining Disele filter
This is really simple process on this car. The Disele filter is located in the engine compartment, to the right of the engine.

- Find a small jar to collect water and disele. (Tip the lid to a paint spray can is the perfect size)
- Place the jar under the filter
- Turn the lever on top of the filter, and collect waist fluid
- Turn back the lever

It is not uncommon that no fluid is drained from the filter, and nothing to worry about.
